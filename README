discription:        This is a project for CS74, taught by Professor Torresani 
                    in winter 2013. The program solves the spoken language
                    identification problem with artificial neural network,
                    but also provides implementation of SVM and decision-
                    tree for comparison.

| 3. how to set up and run  |
 ---------------------------
(1) if you choose to use example training/testting data, skip to step (4)
(2) create your own resources directory as shown above;
(3) fill each sub directory in ./wav with wave files from each language; 
(4) make sure no miscellaneous or hidden files exist in ./wav and its sub directories;
(5) run proper sections of automateimport.m to preprocess and store the preprocessed data;
(6) load the preprocessed data into current workspace;
(7) open automatenet.m, fill the ARG matrix with parameters matching those in your workspace;
(8) run automatenet.m and the training process with be displayed, the outcome will be stored
    in ./slid;
(9) run automatesvm.m and automatedt.m the same way as in (6);
    WARNING: you computer may crash from running automatesvm.m on large dataset. 
(10) load and analyze results.
